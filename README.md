# Wealthy MCP(Model Context Protocol) Server

This repository contains official Wealthy mcp server to help users with trading platform features
# MCP (Mark3 Labs Control Plane) Tools

This repository contains MCP server that provides integration with multiple tools. It also provides a framework for building and integrating various tools that can be used with the MCP server.


## Prerequisites

- Wealthy trading account - https://www.wealthy.in/broking
- Golang(go) 1.23 or later - https://go.dev/doc/install
- MCP clients - Claude or Cursor
- Go 1.23 or later


## Getting Started

You can either install from source or download pre-built artifacts:

### Option 1: Install from Source
- Install using golang(go 1.23 or later):
   ```bash
   go install github.com/wealthy/wealthy-mcp@latest
   ```

### Option 2: Download Pre-built Artifacts
- Visit our [releases page](https://github.com/wealthy/wealthy-mcp/releases) to download the latest pre-built binary for your platform
- Extract the downloaded archive and place the executable in a directory that's in your system PATH

## MCP Cursor Configuration

To configure MCP (Multi-Cursor Protocol) servers, create a `.cursor/mcp.json` file in your home directory with the following structure:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
      "wealthy-mcp": {
        "command": "mcp_server"
      }
    }
}
``` 


-  Restart Claude/Cursor
- Wealthy login page will be opened, enter wealthy credentials and after successful login, return to Claude/Cursor
- We have setup wealthy mcp server now you are ready to do some smart trading ðŸŽ‰

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wealthy/wealthy-mcp.git
   cd mcp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

## Creating a New Tool

To create a new tool, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file in the `tools` directory for your tool (e.g., `tools/my_tool.go`):
   ```go
   package tools

   import (
       "context"
       "github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go/server"
       "github.com/wealthy/wealthy-mcp"
   )

   // Define your tool's parameters
   type MyToolParams struct {
       // Add your parameters with jsonschema tags for documentation
       Param1 string `json:"param1" jsonschema:"description=Description of param1"`
       Param2 int    `json:"param2" jsonschema:"description=Description of param2"`
   }

   // Implement your tool's handler function
   func handleMyTool(ctx context.Context, args MyToolParams) (any, error) {
       // Implement your tool's logic here
       return nil, nil
   }

   // Define your tool using MustTool
   var MyTool = mcp.MustTool(
       "my_tool",                    // Tool name
       "Description of my tool",     // Tool description
       handleMyTool,                 // Handler function
   )

   // Create a registration function
   func AddMyTool(mcp *server.MCPServer) {
       MyTool.Register(mcp)
   }
   ```

2. Register your tool in your main application (typically in main.go):
   ```go
   func main() {
       server := mcp.NewServer()
       tools.AddMyTool(server)  // Register your new tool
       // ... rest of your server setup
   }
   ```

## Tool Definition Best Practices

1. **Parameter Documentation**: Always provide clear descriptions for your tool's parameters using the `jsonschema` tag.

2. **Error Handling**: Return meaningful errors that can help users understand what went wrong.

3. **Type Safety**: Use strongly typed parameter structures.

4. **Context Usage**: Always accept and use the context parameter for cancellation and timeout support.

5. **Tool Registration**: Follow the naming convention `Add<ToolName>` for your registration function.

6. **Package Structure**: Place all tool-related code in the `tools` package.

## Example: Plane.io Integration

The repository includes an example integration with Plane.io in the `plane` directory. This demonstrates how to:

- Define tool models with proper JSON schema tags
- Implement tool handlers with proper error handling
- Structure your code for maintainability
- Write tests for your tools

## Testing

Write tests for your tools using Go's testing package:

```go
func TestMyTool(t *testing.T) {
    ctx := context.Background()
    req := MyToolRequest{
        Param1: "test",
        Param2: 42,
    }
    
    resp, err := MyToolHandler(ctx, req)
    if err != nil {
        t.Fatalf("unexpected error: %v", err)
    }
    
    // Add your assertions here
}
```
